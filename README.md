PROJECT SUMMARY:
The Tech Workshop project is a responsive, user-centric website developed by a team of five students from the Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore, as their final AICT course project.
The platform serves as an educational hub offering curated technical workshops in emerging domains including Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Cybersecurity. 
Built with HTML and CSS, the website features a modern dark-themed interface with intuitive navigation through a top bar and left sidebar, complemented by social media integration for enhanced user engagement.
The project emphasizes structured learning pathways, clear information hierarchy, and visual data representation of course analytics and participant demographics. 
Successfully deployed via GitHub Pages, this initiative demonstrates practical application of web development fundamentals while promoting accessible technology education and professional skill development within an academic framework.
